//You can also have else if statements. As the name suggests,
// it is a combination of else and if. Like else,
// it extends an if statement to execute a different set of statements in case the original
// if expression evaluates to false. Then, the conditions present inside the else if blocks are checked.
// Once a condition evaluates to true, remaining else if and else statements are skipped.
//When all the conditions are false, the else block is executed. Coding the else block is optional.
