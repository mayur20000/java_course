The 'for' loop is used when the number of iterations are known.

for(<initialization>; <condition>; <increment/decrement>) {
  <statements>;
}

# Initialization: It is used for initializing the variables used for checking the condition.
 It is executed only once and gets executed when the loop starts.

# Condition: It is used for checking the condition to decide whether the loop should be terminated or executed.
 If the condition is true, the body of the loop is executed, else loop terminates.

# Increment / Decrement: It increments or decrements the value of the variable used for checking the condition after every
iteration of the loop.
