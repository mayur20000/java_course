//When the loop has to be executed at least once before the condition is checked,
// do-while loop is used. After the first execution, the loop then gets repeated as long as the condition is true.
// In case of do-while loop,the condition is tested after executing the code block.
// Hence, it is called an exit-controlled loop.
