//Control Structures in Programming
//Overview
//Definition: Control structures manage the flow of a program.
//Purpose: They determine which instructions are executed and in what order.

// ## Types of Control Structures ##

// -- Sequential: Executes statements line by line.
// -- Selection: Chooses different paths (e.g., if, else).
// -- Iteration: Repeats a block of code (e.g., for, while loops).
// -- Jump: Alters the flow (e.g., break, continue, return).
