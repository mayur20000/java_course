//Similarly, in programming, when you want to repeatedly execute the statements as long as a condition is met,
// you can use the iteration control structure called while loop.
// When the condition becomes false,the while loop terminates and control goes
// to the statement written after the while loop.
// The while loop is used when the number of iterations are not known.
// In case of while loop, the condition is tested before entering the while loop block and hence
// it is known as an entry-controlled loop.
